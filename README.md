TinySizer aims to be a lightweight structural sizing program which also includes cool visualization features for better interpretation of the given data.

Our main mission for this program to be: lightweight, fast, aesthetically pleasing.

By doing the above we are tryin to build something we would use (I guess).

TODO: 

🟢 Breakdown all the requirements (initially)

- Build GUI
- Load Files
- Visualize Files


🟢 Decide on the project structure

```
main.py/
tinysizer/
├── analysis/
│   └── code.py
├── file/
│   └── code.py
├── gui/
│   ├── code.py
│   └── pics/
|   └── styles/
├── utils/
│   └── code.py
└── visualization/
    └── code.py
```

 
🟢 Decide on the programming language(s)</summary>

| Language | Speed  | Ease of Use | Best For                         |
| -------- | ------ | ----------- | -------------------------------- |
| C        | 🔥🔥🔥 | 😬          | Raw parsing, embedded systems    |
| C++      | 🔥🔥🔥 | 😀          | Clean, fast, modern parsing      |
| Rust     | 🔥🔥🔥 | 😐          | Safety + speed (steeper curve)   |
| Go       | 🔥🔥   | 😀😀        | Simpler tools, CLI apps          |
| Python   | 🔥     | 😍😍😍      | High-level scripting, slow parse |

**Recommended**: Use **C++** — especially with modern features (`std::string_view`, `std::vector`, `unordered_map`, etc.).
